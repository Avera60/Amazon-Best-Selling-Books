# Amazon-Best-Selling-Books
This is a dataset based on *Amazon Top 50 Bestselling books from 2009'-2019'*. I obtained from Kaggle at the link I'll insert at the end of this notebook. The purpose of my analysis is to determine whether to incorporate newer or older books into our stock based on the number of ratings, fiction or non-fiction, and reviews output. Enjoy
